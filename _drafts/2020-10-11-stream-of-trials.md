In a way, this residency is a follow up to the [Supermarket Art Fair](../rediscover-stockholm/): SIGN and I travelled to Stockholm, we met [Videokaffe](http://www.videokaffe.com) and since then I've been [working with them](../art-teleported/). Mostly from a distance, by connecting our studios together through the web using cameras and projectors in a cross-location live performance format called Screen Breach.

I asked [project space SIGN](https://sign2.nl) if we could develop this further. The idea for a residency was born. SIGN and I selected artists we hoped would fit and would enjoy working with Videokaffe and me in a lab setting. The aim was to experiment together and stream it for the world to see. So I called it: Stream of Trials.

Experiment, trial and error and try-outs: that's what [Mark Andreas](http://www.reactivesculpture.com), [Sebastian Ziegler](https://sebastianziegler.info), [Sunjoo Lee](https://sunjoolee.cargo.site), [Jean-François Peschot](http://jeanfrancoispeschot.com), [Lee McDonald](http://leemcdonald.co.uk) and I have been doing the past two months in the *Stream of Trials* residency. We've had [great energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LgMupNMFZE), remote controlled drawing robots, [dance performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pNhEOEhPH8), grass growing in patterns, and much much more.
