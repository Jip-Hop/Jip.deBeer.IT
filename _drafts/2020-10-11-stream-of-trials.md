In a way, the [Stream of Trials residency](https://sign2.nl/events/stream-of-trials-videokaffe-jip-de-beer-e-a/) is a follow up to the Supermarket Art Fair: [SIGN and I travelled to Stockholm](../rediscover-stockholm/), we met [Videokaffe](http://www.videokaffe.com) and since then I've been [working with them](../art-teleported/). Mostly from a distance, by connecting our studios together through the web using cameras and projectors in a cross-location live performance format called Screen Breach.

I asked [project space SIGN](https://sign2.nl) if we could develop this further. The idea for a residency was born. SIGN and I selected artists we hoped would make for a good chemistry while working with Videokaffe and me in a lab setting. The aim was to experiment together and stream it for the world to see. So I coined: Stream of Trials.

Experiments, try-outs, trial and error: that sums up what [Mark Andreas](http://www.reactivesculpture.com), [Sebastian Ziegler](https://sebastianziegler.info), [Sunjoo Lee](https://sunjoolee.cargo.site), [Jean-François Peschot](http://jeanfrancoispeschot.com), [Lee McDonald](http://leemcdonald.co.uk) and I have been doing the past two months. We've had [great energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LgMupNMFZE), remote controlled (drawing) robots, [dance performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pNhEOEhPH8), grass growing in patterns, a huge multichannel screen sculpture suspended from the ceiling, and much much more. For all of that, [browse the visual documentation](https://www.flickr.com/photos/170080136@N06/albums/72157715880233003) on Flickr. Or read an interesting review by [Jegens en Tevens](https://jegensentevens.nl/2020/09/steam-of-trial-and-error-sign/) (in Dutch). This post will mostly be about my process during the residency.

Planting grass seeds, that's the first thing I did. The idea was to try out a concept, on a small scale, and work on other ideas while the grass takes its time to grow. In my [Web Spaces](../new-manhattan-the-opening/) series I explore the urban landscape of web pages. But I've been [wondering for a while](../depth-perception-browser-add-on/) if there's a more organic landscape hidden underneath the computer screen...

In the months preceding the residency, I've been recording all of my mouse movements. From opening my laptop, until closing it or until it went to sleep. I made a little program which would store screenshots of what I'd been doing on the computer during that time, alongside all of these 'drawing sessions'. I say 'drawing sessions', because the way I see it I'm continuously (subconsciously) drawing a line with the mouse cursor. On my computer I now have a database of about 800 of these drawings: time to experiment with how to get them out of it. 

Back to the grass. Imagine you're strolling through a field. You're leaving a trail along the way. Looking from above, the path you've taken is a drawing of your journey. But instead of you walking, it's the journey of the mouse cursor: Mouse Trails. I laser cut shapes out of wood, which were derived from the Mouse Trials, so I could make the grass grow in patterns to simulate trails in grass...

While waiting for the grass to sprout, I built a custom Makelangelo drawing robot and installed an AxiDraw V3 drawing machine. To explore other ways to make the Mouse Trials come to life.

I picked the Mouse Trails from my database, to be translated into artworks, according to some criteria. A session needs to be visually distinctive (not too similar), should been clear (so not too much multitasking between programs without a single objective) and lend itself for a funny title which would hint to what was going on during the session (preferably a bit ambiguous, to confuse the fact if it was an action performed in the virtual of physical world).

Due to the Corona pandemic, many activities (which would ordinarily be performed physically) are now done behind the computer, with a mouse cursor. Grocery shopping for example, is one of those things for me. The corresponding Mouse Trials made the selection.

In addition to the 2D representations of my mouse drawings, I was determined to 3D-print these trails too. So I made another program which interprets the cursor session in the following way: the line starts at the bottom. With every mouse movement in the session, the line would not only move along the x and y (2D) axis, but it would also go up a little bit (along the z axis) line would , and while  which would start with a 3D the line start at the bottom the line to an algorithm which would  

But as I'm not a magician, I can't have the line [levitate in the air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rope_trick) like [a magic rope](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-a-coil-of-rope-with-one-end-standing-upright-as-in-the-indian-rope-41922180.html). So I fed the line to an algorithm which supports it with a tree-like structure. The result is an organic looking three-dimensional object, based on the trail made by my mouse cursor while performing a specific task.

The grass sprouted and for a brief moment the patterns were there too. Although not with the same fidelity present in the Mouse Trials with a 3D-printer or pen plotters. It would probably work better on a much bigger scale. Never the less I enjoyed the results, and telling visitors the story behind it.
