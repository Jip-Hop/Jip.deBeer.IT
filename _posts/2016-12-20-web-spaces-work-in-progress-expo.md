To the *Work in Progress* exhibition by _Platform Minerva_ I've contributed [Web Spaces](../web-spaces-3d-printed-web-pages/), a series of 3D printed webpages in combination with *Architectural Explorations*, a dual-screen interactive installation.

On the walls I've presented two additional projection works, of which one is also interactive.

Web Spaces is produced as part of the Summer Sessions Network for Talent Development in a co-production of Kitchen Budapest and V2\_ Lab for the Unstable Media, with support of the Creative Industries Fund NL.
