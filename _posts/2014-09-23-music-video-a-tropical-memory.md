Memories from our summer holiday in Singapore and Malaysia.

Song: Rude, by: Magic!

Shot on Nikon 1 V2. The V2 has just one frame rate option in 1080p, which is 30fps. That doesn't intercut well with the burst mode, for which I always use a 24fps time line to get the most out of the footage.

1 NIKKOR Lenses used:

- 1 NIKKOR 18.5mm f/1.8
- 1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6
- 1 NIKKOR VR 30-110mm f/3.8-5.6

Manual canon lenses used:

- Canon FD 50mm f1.8
- Canon FD 70-210mm f4

The experience with manual lenses on the Nikon 1 for shooting anything unpredictable is really bad. No metering, just full manual mode and you can't judge the exposure by the image you see on screen because the screen has 'auto gain'. So your image will look bright all the time, instead of showing you how your photo will be exposed when you press the shutter button. Useless!

All burst shots were done in RAW and processed in After Effects... which was super super slow! I don't think I'll ever make a video like that again.

Sorry for the bad audio quality. Sadly, I didn't have my Zoom H4n recorder with me.
