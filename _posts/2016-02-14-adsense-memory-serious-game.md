> “You've got a memory, but so does the Internet! If you're using an ad blocker than this game is probably not for you. If you aren't, then AdSense Memory will raise your adwareness!”

I've developed this game to put ads front and center. Instead of stuff you'd rather ignore, in AdSense Memory the advertisements themselves are in the spotlight. The ads are the content.

Interested in my critical reflection on online advertising? Curious what advertisements Google deems appropriate for you? Or just want to play a memory game?

**Update 19th of November 2020:** AdSense stopped working for me. As a result the game is no longer available.
