I've made [a little video mapping browser extension](http://mappertje.debeer.it)! It's simple. Aim your beamer at a rectangular surface and drag 4 corners to precisely map your video onto the target surface. But it's also advanced. With it you can correct the perspective of the video source too. Just choose any region on the source video, which is distorted due to perspective but is supposed to be rectangular, and Mappertje will set it straight :) A bit like the Perspective Warp tool in Photoshop.

{% include figure image_path="2020/05/22//demo.gif" caption="Mappertje in action (just imagine this being projected with a beamer)" alt="" class="" max_width=480 max_height=300%}

You can also try the [online version of Mappertje](https://mappertje.debeer.it/src/#/) (supports Firefox too) without having to install anything. But the Mappertje extension integrates nicely with my [Pop-out Jitsi Meet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-out-jitsi-meet/boklbbjieahngbnhdmlhldjjibdnnbcn/) extension, which makes it super easy to projection map live video from remote locations!
