Whooho I've been awarded the Reisma Van den Burg Grant! This grant is named after the Frisian painter Cor Reisma (1902-1962) and is offered by his family. The biennial stipend is intended to give recent graduates from the Minerva Art Academy an opportunity to further develop their work through an (inter)national project.

Stay tuned for my developments, as I will start to collaborate with the international Media Art collective [Videokaffe](http://www.videokaffe.com)!

The photo, by Harma Kaput, shows the three winners of Minerva Art Academy awards: Vassilena Petrova, Jip de Beer and Antonia Oana. I'm holding an artwork by [Jos Volkers,](http://josvolkers.com) which has been given to me as part of the award.
