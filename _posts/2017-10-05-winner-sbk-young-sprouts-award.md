Quoting my girlfriend: "It's quite a an honour that you've won this award, because there's a lot of impressive work in this exhibition! And I agree with that. The [SBK Sprouts Young Talents 2017](https://www.sbk.nl/index.php?r=site/page&view=expositie&id=245) exhibition is a diverse and interesting selection of 50 graduates from the Dutch art academies. What set me apart in this show according to the jury is the fact that I'm showing a lot, using different media: print, 3D print, screen based interactive installation and text. This is to ensure the whole story and research behind Web Spaces comes across. To make my world more accessible for the audience. Also, I was complimented for being able to talk 'deliciously' about what I'm doing and for making work capturing the Zeitgeist.
