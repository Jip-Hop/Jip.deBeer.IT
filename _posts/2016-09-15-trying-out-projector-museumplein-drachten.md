I've been asked by Museum Dr8888 to make an interactive light installation for the Museumplein in Drachten. It will run every evening, for three months, starting mid October.

Yesterday evening I started to experiment with what's available: a 4x5m floor projection, a top mounted camera and a computer running AdVis 2.1 software.

Unfortunately AdVis, which is a software to make interactive projections with, wouldn't recognize the people walking in the projection area. Also, with AdVis you can only tweak some very simple, ready-made, interactive projections. So I don't think I'm going to be using that...

From the top mounted camera I got a very noise black and white signal... But when I projected the noisy camera feed on the floor immediately some pedestrians started playing with their own top projection! I think the camera could drive some interesting interactive projection. Let's see what I can come up with in the coming weeks!
