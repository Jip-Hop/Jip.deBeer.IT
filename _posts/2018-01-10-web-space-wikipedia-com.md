Already from the start, during the [Graduation Show](../web-spaces-graduation-show-frank-mohr-institute-2017/), and at the [Young Sprouts exhibition](../winner-sbk-young-sprouts-award/), art collectors expressed interest in acquiring the Web Space of Wikipedia. I'm proud to announce that since last month it has joined many other artworks in the very diverse collection of Mr. Verberg!
