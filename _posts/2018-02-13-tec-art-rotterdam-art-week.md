At the [TEC ART](https://2018.tecart.nl) exhibition, during Rotterdam Art Week, you could once again explore the world of Web Spaces! I had my dual-screen interactive installation up and running, where webpages are transformed into 3D 'buildings' in real time. As well as 3D prints of worlds most valuable webpage's, printed in precious metals.

I also got some nice compliments during the show. One of them was the following: "At the same time, you learn something." I was glad to hear that, because I try to make my work and the world of Web Spaces accessible to the visitors. That's also why I always take along the banner (see image above), which accompanies the works with some explanation and context. I think some of the other works in the exhibition would have benefited from some (more) explanation/description as well. I feel some of their context was lost in the chaos that is TEC ART.

Chaos or not, TEC ART was definitely a great spectacle!
