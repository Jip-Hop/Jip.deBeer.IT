Web Spaces - 3D Printed Web Pages is a project I've been working on during the Summer Sessions 2016 residency. There's a nice article about it on the V2\_ webpage which introduces the project like this:

<blockquote>Jip de Beer's Web Spaces is an ongoing investigation into the structure of web pages. How can three dimensional beings, like you and me, explore the virtual landscape of web pages? By rendering the building blocks of a web page in three dimensions, the architecture beneath its surface is revealed.</blockquote>

You can read the full article on [the V2\_ website](http://v2.nl/archive/works/web-spaces).

This project is produced as part of the Summer Sessions Network for Talent Development in a co-production of Kitchen Budapest and V2\_ Lab for the Unstable Media, with support of the Creative Industries Fund NL.
