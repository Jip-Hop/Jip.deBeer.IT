For over a year now, I've been emailing IMDb users to let them know they're involved in my [Rapping.Reviews](../rapping-reviews-has-been-released/) project. Every day I send 30 emails, which means I've sent approximately 10.000 emails during this time! Its rather time-consuming, but the conversations emerging from this endeavor are incredibly interesting to me and valuable to my ongoing research into topics like privacy, information overload and authorship.

As part of a work presentation for tutors and fellow students, I decided to print out some of these email conversations. Herewith I show the scale of my undertaking and allow them a peek into my personal inbox. It just took me a couple of hours to put everything on the wall.
