Through video installation and drawing Burtonwood explores how vision is structured and how we make sense of what we see. This exhibition _Vision Machines_ will probe the space between observing and surveilling, watching and seeing, the virtual and the real.

Using custom built apparatuses made from networked microcomputer systems Burtonwood will create a series of work designed to explore how technology alters perception.

_\* Screen Breach is a collaboration method using the world wide web to explore a form of physical telepresence. The collective meets regularly online by connecting their artist studios via webcams and video projectors. Through this process, the members work together as if they are sharing the same space._

_The group builds simultaneous kinetic sculptures and makes drawings, these works are partly virtual, partly physical and effect each other in real time. The video happenings function as a bridge between the digital and the analog, creating exciting feedback loops between the artists._
