I'm proud to announce that [In4Art](http://www.in4art.eu), a European innovation company, has added two of my _Web Spaces_ to their *Next Generation Internet* art collection.

It's my very first (and tiny) _Web Space_ made from metal that's joining them.

> Web Space - Google.com (2017); 3D printed web page, casted in four pieces of solid metal (brass, polished brass, bronze, polished bronze), base 3D printed in Bronzefill; 2.5x2.5x1.5cm; Unique

The other work In4Art acquired is a 2D one.

These works will be on display during the upcoming Innovatism Salon in the In4Art Project Space, a group exhibition with works from Daniel Canogar, Constant Dullaart, Harm van den Dorpel, Willem Besselink, Jasper van Loenen, Carl Alexander, Ruben van de Ven and myself. The Salon is free to visit on May 18, 19, 20 and 25, 26, 27 between 13.00 and 17.00 at Nieuwe Keizersgracht 54, 1018 DT Amsterdam.

Part of the Salon format are the Sunday Afternoon Conversations. The Sunday afternoon conversations will take place on Sunday May 20th from 15.00 – 17.00 and Sunday May 27th between 15.00 – 17.00 and are free to join. The theme of the conversation is radical observations & artistic prototypes in the field of IoT.
