This is a video I quickly threw together during the first days of my study exchange period in Singapore to show to friends and family that we've arrived safely and that we were already riding bicycles! Used the Nikon 1 V2's burst mode feature to get high quality footage.

I was planning to make a series of these video's but I never officially made a part II. But the unofficial sequel to this video is [A Tropical Memory](../music-video-a-tropical-memory/).
