The [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/7243-new-manhattanthe-web-space-never-sleeps-1) for New Manhattan was a succes! At the moment I'm still busy with 3D-printing the architecture of 60 webpages and finishing the interactive installation. But I'd already like to invite you for the opening of the exhibition. The opening takes place on Tuesday the 8th of January at 16:30 in Groningen.

This is the best moment to come and see how the city turned out and meet all the participants. It's also the moment, if all goes well, when the New Manhattan book will be launched.

We'll have some drinks and snacks and I'm looking forward to see you there!

**Location:** Groninger Forum (Public Library), Oude Boteringestraat 18, 9712 GH Groningen. **Date and time:** Tuesday the 8th of January 2019, from 16:30 to 18:00.
