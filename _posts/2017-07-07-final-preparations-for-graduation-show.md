After working in my studio at the Frank Mohr institute for two years, it has become a little bit of a mess! But I really enjoyed the space, 24/7 access, the facilities and sharing it with fellow master students :)

At the moment I'm just rounding up for the opening of the [Graduation Show 2017](https://www.facebook.com/events/272817603192760/) (July 9 - July 13), for which I was able to give away 100 free train tickets! This makes our show that bit more accessible to people from across the Netherlands, for whom Groningen might be out of reach.

Hope to see you there!
