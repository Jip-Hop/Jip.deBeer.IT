With your help, I'm going to build New Manhattan: one big artwork that consists of several small artworks. It is a 3D-printed scale model of a fictional city based on the architecture of 100 web pages. And at the same time it's a moment to pause at our digitized society that we have designed ourselves.

Check out the [video and project page at Voordekunst](https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/7243-new-manhattanthe-web-space-never-sleeps-1). They areÂ in Dutch only, so you may have to use a bit of Google Translate.

I hope you'll claim your spot in New Manhattan!
